<h1>About This Project</h1>
<p>During this project, I utilized a JDBC while implementing a connection between MySQL and SpringMVC. </p>
<br>
<h3>Criteria</h3><br>
<p>HTML: I believe that my HTML usage was a 2, as I did not have much information to space out and position.</p><br>
<p>CSS: 3. I used specific ids and classes to target specific items throughout the page.</p><br>
<p>Spring: 4. I met all criteria regarding servlets and I used a bean to create a DAO object upon application startup.</p><br>
<p>MVC: 4. All of my data components were in the form of application objects and command objects were utilized.</p><br>
<p>JSTL: 4. JSTL conditionals were used to iterate through multiple arrays of data to display. </p><br>
<p>SQL: 3. I met the standard on CRUD implementation by giving the user full ability to CRUD.</p><br>
<p>JDBC: 3. I believe I met the standards of handling SQL exceptions and all resources were closed when necessary.</p><br>
<p>Aesthetic: 3. All pages are similar and consistent in design and familiarity.</p><br>
<p>OO Programming: 3. ORM was used by using objects to represent database records. Getters and setters were implemented where necessary.</p>
